                                            <p>The very first Sign of the Hindu Zodiac is Mesha Rashi, which is also
                                                known as the Aries. And, much on the same lines,
                                                the ones born under this Sign consider themselves as the first. They are
                                                known for their leadership qualities and
                                                optimism. Most of the Mesha Rashi or Aries people have a burning desire
                                                to start things off and make things happen.</p>
                                            <p>Mesha (Aries) Rashi is a very important sign that carries a great weight
                                                on its shoulders. According to the ancient
                                                Vedic texts, Mesha Rashi is the sign of God Brahma who is the creator of
                                                the Universe. The ruling planet of Aries is
                                                Mangal Graha (Mars). The planet Mars is a factor of might and enthusiasm
                                                in life. It is put in the category of the fixed
                                                zodiac and its quality is fire-dominant.</p>
                                            <p>Influenced by the Mangal Graha or Mars, Aries ascendant possesses a
                                                strong and attractive body. People born under the
                                                Aries zodiac sign also have a somewhat extroverted personality, being
                                                someone well articulate, who likes a good
                                                conversation, and, above all, who doesnâ€™t mind getting into debates and
                                                making use of arguments that have up the sleeve.
                                                The sign of Aries has a lot of energy within itself, and this energy is
                                                not just used in creation itself. Aries is a
                                                sign that doesnâ€™t like to be tied to the common and every day, thatâ€™s
                                                why, when sheâ€™s not creating, sheâ€™s exploring.</p>
                                            <p>According to the planetary position, the Surya (Sun) is exalted in Aries
                                                zodiac. Sun being in Aries is considered very
                                                beneficial for the people of Aries, Sun gives them strength and courage
                                                so that they can move forward with confidence in
                                                their life. Likewise, Shani Graha (Saturn) occupies a debilitated
                                                position in this zodiac. Under its influence, they can
                                                fall in bad company, its bad effects are also seen on their married
                                                life.</p>

                                                hard-working, rock-solid, stable and practical nature of Taurus or

                                            <p>Most of Taurus born are connoisseurs of good food and a good life.
                                                Paradoxically, though, they are fixed in their
                                                approach; they disregard change. They are loyal and attached to their

                                                because they hate the idea of â€˜changeâ€™. This attribute makes Vrishabha
                                                quite headstrong.</p>

                                            <p>Kumbh Rashi is the eleventh Moon sign of the zodiac. Kumbh Rashi in
                                                English is referred to as the Aquarius Moon Sign. If
                                                the Moon transits through the Aquarius Zodiac sign at the time of your
                                                birth, then your Moon sign is said to be
                                                Aquarius. As per Vedic Astrology, the ruling planet of the Aquarius Moon
                                                sign is Saturn. It is the planet that brings
                                                structure and meaning to life through a strong awareness of limits of
                                                time and matter. Saturn emphasizes the sense of
                                                boundaries, responsibilities and commitments. It allows the native to
                                                practice self-control and self-regulation.
                                                Aquarius Moon sign relates to the Air, the element representing
                                                intellect, detachment and fair-mindedness. The modality
                                                of Kumbh Rashi is the fixed sign. It signifies commitment, focus and
                                                resilience for gaining stability in life. The Moon
                                                in Aquarius exhibits masculine energy which tends to make its natives
                                                extrovert, cautious and straightforward. Kumbh
                                                Rashi rules the eleventh house of the Natal Chart. It is referred to as
                                                the House of gains and profits. It also
                                                represents sudden profits, wealth, abundance, income, accomplishments,
                                                friends, ornaments, freedom from misery and pain.</p>
                                            <p>Kumbh Rashi is symbolized by the water bearer. In Babylonian times, it
                                                was associated with the protective God Ea who
                                                carries an overflowing vase of water. While, in the Egyptian era, it was
                                                related to flooding of the Nile which occurs
                                                when the water bearer dips his pitcher into the great river. It shows
                                                the commencement of spring and the time of
                                                fertility witnessed after the floods. The Aquarius symbol is interpreted
                                                as eternally giving life and spiritual food to
                                                the world. The water in the imagery indicates the fluid that cleanses
                                                the past and creates a room for fresh and new
                                                beginnings. The Aquarius Moon sign symbol represents the forward-looking
                                                and growth-oriented attitude. It shows how the
                                                people born in Kumbha Rashi seek to emphasize dispensing knowledge. They
                                                view everyone equally and also possess a sense
                                                of individuality. The glyph of Aquarius depicts the water flowing from
                                                the water bearerâ€™s vessel. It depicts the
                                                open-ended spirit of the natives born in this Moon sign.</p>

                                            <p>Pisces is the 12th and the last Sign of the Zodiac. It is known that
                                                Pisces somehow, thus, takes ups the different
                                                attributes of all the other 11 Signs. The dreamy and romantic Sign is
                                                known for its charming creative side, which, to
                                                some, is like free flowing poetry, while to others is akin to a fresh
                                                floral blossom. Many find generous and
                                                compassionate Pisces to be selfless, while others may feel that they
                                                (Pisces-born) are a tad rigid or fixed. Well, when
                                                itâ€™s about the Pisces, just like itâ€™s symbol of two fish aligned to swim
                                                in opposite direction, the paradoxes abound.
                                                Ruled by Neptune, Pisces are seen to live in a world of their own; they
                                                tend to be detached, spiritual and quite focused
                                                on their inner journeys aimed at finding peace and harmony. Known to
                                                effortlessly ride the waves, without causing
                                                agitation, the Pisces natives hate confrontations. </p>
                                            <p>They prefer to take roundabouts, instead, and would do all they can
                                                to avoid conflicts. Modest and calm, they love to have and foster a
                                                feeling of security and cosiness around them. These
                                                natives love their cosy nests, and also make wonderful nurturers and
                                                parents. Caring, loving and loyal, Pisces are often
                                                a treat in love, unless they take to a negative manifestation (of their
                                                personality) or are, often irretrievably, jilted
                                                in love. For Fish, love is more about giving than receiving. Tolerant,
                                                respectful and forgiving, however, the Pisces,
                                                however, can be too timid in their ways, and this may make them subject
                                                to ill-treatment or taken for granted or
                                                betrayal. The Pisces also find it hard to change their set ways, and are
                                                found to be pretty lazy and passive. In their
                                                extreme negative behaviour, Pisces may be given to complete inaction,
                                                hedonism, vindictiveness and/ or multiple
                                                relationships.</p>
